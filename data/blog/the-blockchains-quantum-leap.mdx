We see ourselves as a fairly intelligent group of professionals and entrepreneurs :-]. That’s why we decided to ask the Oracle of arguably the most powerful, influential, and dare we say knowledgeable data set known to human kind — Google BARD — the question we posed ourselves several months ago. And the results are mostly in line with our view.

# Our Question

What problems could the blockchain industry solve by leveraging their collective financial value to build pre and post quantum capable DAO owned data centers for the entire blockchain industry and to compete with cloud computing providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google?

# Google BARD's Response

The blockchain industry could solve several problems by leveraging their collective financial value to build pre- and post-quantum capable, DAO-owned data centers for the entire blockchain industry and to compete with cloud computing providers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. 

1) Eliminate reliance on cloud providers and reduce costs: The blockchain industry currently spends billions of dollars annually on cloud computing services. By building their own data centers, the industry could eliminate this reliance on cloud providers and significantly reduce costs. This would also give the industry more control over their data and infrastructure.

2) Enhance scalability and security of blockchain networks: Blockchain networks are often plagued by scalability and security issues. These issues can be exacerbated by the reliance on cloud providers, which can be vulnerable to attacks and outages. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could implement more robust security measures and develop more scalable solutions.

3) Foster the growth of BaaS, AI, and quantum computing: Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing are all emerging technologies with the potential to revolutionize industries. However, these technologies require access to secure, scalable, and reliable infrastructure. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could provide the necessary infrastructure to foster the growth of these technologies.

4) Establish a decentralized backbone for quantum computing networks: Quantum computing is a rapidly developing technology with the potential to solve complex problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. However, quantum computers are very expensive and require specialized infrastructure. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could establish a decentralized backbone for quantum computing networks, making these powerful computers more accessible and affordable.

5) Gain control over data and infrastructure: The blockchain industry currently relies on third-party cloud providers to store and manage their data. This creates a number of risks, including the potential for data breaches and censorship. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could gain control over their data and infrastructure, ensuring that their data is secure and that they are not subject to censorship.

6) Reduce reliance on third-party vendors: The blockchain industry currently relies on a number of third-party vendors to provide services such as data storage, networking, and security. This can create a number of problems, including compatibility issues and vendor lock-in. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could reduce their reliance on third-party vendors and gain more control over their technology stack.

7) Implement enhanced security measures: The blockchain industry is a prime target for cyberattacks. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could implement enhanced security measures to protect their networks from attacks. This could include measures such as hardware security modules (HSMs), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

8) Position the blockchain industry for future growth and innovation: The blockchain industry is still in its early stages of development. By building their own data centers, the blockchain industry could position itself for future growth and innovation. This would give the industry the flexibility to experiment with new technologies and develop new products and services.

Overall, the potential benefits of the blockchain industry building their own data centers are significant. By solving the problems outlined above, the industry could reduce costs, enhance security, and foster innovation. This would ultimately benefit the entire blockchain ecosystem and help to realize the full potential of blockchain technology. 

Whether you’re a blockchain developer, enthusiast, founder, investor, miner, stake pool operator, blogger, recruiter, community manager, or anyone else in the industry, can you think of a more effective use of our resources at this pivotal moment as we race ahead toward the most significant technological change in the history of human kind?

These are just a few of the developments that happened in the tech world almost one year ago now: 

- Photonic compute all the way down to mobile devices
- The return of analog 
- HPC with 25,000 times the capacity of ChatGPT
- IonQ who produces data center pluggable quantum computers believes quantum advantage is imminent 
- Oded Regev of NYU cut Schor’s algorithm in half in August 2023 essentially meaning the compute power needed to hack 65% of existing Ethereum addresses also halved all while LightSolver's laser powered, desktop size computer runs polynomial time algos that optimize problems with 120^100 combinations at a rate faster than any computer available today.
